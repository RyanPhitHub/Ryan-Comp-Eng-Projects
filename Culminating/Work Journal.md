## **Journey to Lightsaber**

### Day 1: May. 26, 2022
Mr. Lam gave me 2 new beepers/speakers, and an accelerometer. I'm happy with how the new speaker sounds, but I noticed that the sound of the speaker is heavily muted if you cover the top- I'll have to design the hilt so the speakers are open-faced on the surface. I won't be soldering on the accelerometer yet though, since Mr. Lam wants to add ports so that I can just plug the new components in without committing to a solder. In the future, I should be more gentle while stripping wires.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Progress:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - desoldered old beeper and removed it from my UBMP4  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - soldered wires onto the new speaker and then soldered it onto my UBMP4  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - tested the sound of the new speaker with my [blaster code](https://github.com/RyanPhitHub/Ryan-Comp-Eng-Projects/blob/706510888d710a99c2e0921ca4e99c50fcff2e93/Loop-Blaster.md)
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setbacks and Concerns:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - after soldering the new speaker to the board, [one of the wires snapped :,(](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99211784/170848646-4abf5f6e-219c-436b-b169-4499ec502a3a.JPG) , but I'm hoping   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's just a bad wire or I damaged it while stripping it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - my hands have been really shakey recently, I might have to see a doctor since soldering may become dangerous  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - I'm having trouble understanding which pins I need to solder on my accelerometer; I'm using [this document](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL345.pdf) for reference but I feel  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the engineer and physics vocubulary is way too high level and I'm going nowhere with it
